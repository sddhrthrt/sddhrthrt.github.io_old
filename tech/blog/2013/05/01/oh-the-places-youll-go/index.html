<div class="entry-content"><p>This is a beautiful poem I found from the movie Fracture. It&#8217;s written
by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh,_the_Places_You'll_Go!">Dr. Seuss</a>. It&#8217;s inspiring!</p>

<blockquote><p>Congratulations!<br/>
Today is your day,<br/>
You&#8217;re off to Great Places!<br/>
You&#8217;re off and away!</p>

<p>You have brains in your head.<br/>
You have feet in your shoes.<br/>
You can steer yourself<br/>
any direction you choose.<br/>
You&#8217;re on your own. And you know what you know.<br/>
And YOU are the guy who&#8217;ll decide where to go.<br/>
<!-- more -->
You&#8217;ll look up and down streets. Look &#8216;em over with care.<br/>
About some you will say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t choose to go there.&#8221;<br/>
With your head full of brains, and your shoes full of feet,<br/>
you&#8217;re too smart to go down any not-so-good street.</p>

<p>And you may not find any<br/>
you&#8217;ll want to go down.<br/>
In that case, of course,<br/>
you&#8217;ll head straight out of town.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s opener there<br/>
in the wide open air.</p>

<p>Out there things can happen<br/>
and frequently do <br/>
to people as brainy<br/>
and footsy as you.</p>

<p>And when things start to happen,<br/>
don&#8217;t worry. Don&#8217;t stew.<br/>
Just go right along.<br/>
You&#8217;ll start happening too.</p>

<p>OH!<br/>
THE PLACES YOU&#8217;LL GO!</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll be on your way up!<br/>
You&#8217;ll be seeing great sites! <br/>
You&#8217;ll join the high fliers!<br/>
who soar to high heights.</p>

<p>You won&#8217;t lag behind, because you&#8217;ll have the speed.<br/>
You&#8217;ll pass the whole gang and you&#8217;ll soon take the lead.<br/>
Wherever you fly, you&#8217;ll be best of the best.<br/>
Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.</p>

<p>Except when you don&#8217;t.<br/>
Because, sometimes, you won&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry to says so<br/>
but, sadly, it&#8217;s true<br/>
that Bang-ups<br/>
and Hang-ups<br/>
can happen to you</p>

<p>You can get all hung up<br/>
in a prickle-ly perch.<br/>
And your gang will fly on.<br/>
You&#8217;ll be left in a Lurch.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll come down from the Lunch<br/>
wuth an unpleasant bump.<br/>
And the chances are, then,<br/>
that you&#8217;ll be in a Slump.</p>

<p>And when you&#8217;re in a Slump,<br/>
you&#8217;re not in for much fun.<br/>
Un-slumping yourself <br/>
is not easily done.</p>

<p>You will come to a place where the streets are not marked.<br/>
Some windows are lighted. But mostly they&#8217;re dark.<br/>
A place that could sprain both elbow and chin!<br/>
Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in?<br/>
How much can you lose? How much can you win?</p>

<p>And IF you should go in,should you turn left or right&#8230;<br/>
or right-and-three-quaters? Or maybe not quite?<br/>
Or go around and back and sneak from behind?<br/>
Simple it&#8217;s not, I&#8217;m afraid you will find,<br/>
for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.</p>

<p>You can get so confused <br/>
that you&#8217;ll start in to race<br/>
down long and wiggled roads at a break-necking pace<br/>
and grind on for miles across weirdish wild space,<br/>
headed, I fear, toward a most usless place</p>

<p>The Waiting Place&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230;for people just waiting.</p>

<p>Waiting for a train to go<br/>
or a bus to come, or a plane to go<br/>
or the mail to come, or the rain to go<br/>
or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow<br/>
or waiting around for a Yes or a No<br/>
or waiting for their hair to grow.<br/>
Everyone is just waiting.</p>

<p>Waiting for the fish to bite<br/>
or waiting for wind to fly a kite<br/>
or waiting around for Friday night<br/>
or waiting, perhaps, for their uncle Jake<br/>
or a pot to boil, or a Better Break<br/>
or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants<br/>
or a wig with curls, or Another Chance.<br/>
Everyone is just waiting.</p>

<p>NO!<br/>
That&#8217;s not for you!</p>

<p>Somehow you&#8217;ll escape<br/>
all that waiting and staying.<br/>
You&#8217;ll find the bright places<br/>
where boom bands are playing.</p>

<p>Oh, the places you&#8217;ll go! There is fun to be done!<br/>
There are points to be scored. There are games to be won.<br/>
And the magical things you can do with that ball<br/>
will make you the winning-est winner of all.<br/>
Fame! You&#8217;ll be famous as famous can be,<br/>
with the whole wide world watching you win on TV.</p>

<p>Except when they don&#8217;t.<br/>
Because, sometimes, they won&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m afraid that some times<br/>
you&#8217;ll play lonely games too.<br/>
Games you can&#8217;t win<br/>
&#8216;cause you&#8217;ll play against you.</p>

<p>All Alone!<br/>
Whether you like it or not.<br/>
Alone will be something<br/>
you&#8217;ll be quite a lot.</p>

<p>And when you&#8217;re alone, theres a very good chance<br/>
you&#8217;ll meet things that scare you right out of your pants.<br/>
There are some, down the road between hither and yon,<br/>
that can scare you so much you won&#8217;t want to go on.</p>

<p>But on you will go<br/>
though the whether be foul.<br/>
On you will go<br/>
though your enemies prowl.<br/>
On you will go<br/>
though the Hakken-Kraks howl.<br/>
Onward up many<br/>
a frightening creek,<br/>
though you arms may get sore<br/>
and your sneakers may leak.</p>

<p>On and on you will hike.<br/>
And I know you&#8217;ll hike far<br/>
and face up to your problems<br/>
whatever they are.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll get mixed up of course,<br/>
as you already know.<br/>
You&#8217;ll get mixed up<br/>
with many stray birds as you go.<br/>
So be sure when you step.<br/>
Step with care and great tact<br/>
and remember that Life&#8217;s<br/>
a Great Balancing Act.<br/>
Just never forget to be dexterous and deft.<br/>
And never mix up your right foot with you left.</p>

<p>And will you succeed?<br/>
Yes! You will indeed!<br/>
(98 and 3/4 percent garanteed!)</p>

<p>KID YOU&#8217;LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!</p>

<p>So&#8230;<br/>
be your name Buxbaum or Bixby or Bray<br/>
or Mordecai Ali Van Alenn O&#8217;Shea<br/>
you&#8217;re off to Great Places!<br/>
Today is your day!<br/>
Your mountain is waiting.<br/>
So&#8230; get on your way!</p></blockquote>
