<div class="entry-content"><p>I am a Tata DOCOMO subscriber for the last 3 years, as far as I remember. It&#8217;s a
service that is available in towns and not so prominent in villages. I face
trouble when I go back to my hometown, but I bear with it for the good offers
they have.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the relationship with this network has not been sweet always. There
are far many incidents I remember when they took away my money for no apparent
mistake of mine, but then I had customer support, whom I could contact for
clarification/refund whenever applicable. I think when we pay an entity large
amounts of money without real receipt/acknowledgement, the customer support
plays a very important role in creating trust. Prompt, responsible customer care
means one can ensure that his money is in safe hands.</p>

<p>Recently, Tata DOCOMO has become outrageous in terms of customer support,
honesty and responsibility. I wish to detail this one encounter among the
numerous ones that I had with this company.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The story</h2>

<p>I received a message after a call along with the call cost report saying:
&#8220;RC250 for 222.5 Talktime and 1GB 3G internet valid for 30 days&#8221;. I immediately
thought this was a very good offer and I proceeded to recharge.</p>

<p><img src="/images/1.jpg" alt="1.jpg" /></p>

<p>I got these options, in which I tried Special recharge, which didn&#8217;t have the
denomination I was looking for. 3G recharge obviously meant 3G packs, so I went
for Top-Up. 250 denomination was present, which I chose.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2.jpg" alt="2.jpg" /></p>

<p>Now, I proceeded to the next steps and finished recharging using Net Banking.
When I was done, I eagerly opened the phone and reactivated internet only to see
a &#8216;E&#8217; in the top of the screen, as usual, and I couldn&#8217;t use any fast internet.
I immediately suspected something wrong and called the customer care
representative at 121.</p>

<h2>The misery of Customer &#8220;Care&#8221;</h2>

<p>Customer care is another story with Tata DOCOMO. They connect you only once in
24 hours. Whenever else, you get a blunt response : &#8220;All our customer care
representatives are busy helping other customers.&#8221;. That&#8217;s it. So I decided that
I am talking all the details that I need when I call. So having a sketch - ask
about 3G data I have, if not, clarify about recharge, and ask them to correct
the mistake and activate 3G.</p>

<p>A customer care representative picked my call, and asked about my problem. She
came up with this equally irresponsible, rather funny response:
&#8220;Sir, this recharge is available only if you do it with one of our retailers,
and online recharge does not give you any data.&#8221;. Then, to my surprise and
anger, she disconnected the call.</p>

<p>Later, I tried more than 50 times during the day, within 4 hours, for no avail.
All our customer care representatives are busy attending other customers, they
said, adding &#8220;for further support, contact D<em>*ss</em>nt@tatadocomo.com&#8221;. This word
is indecipherable. I listened to the same recorded voice again and again, in
vain, trying to decode that particular word.</p>

<h2>The wonderful website</h2>

<p>Now, I thought the only option left is internet. I visit www.tatadocomo.com, and
navigate through their cumbersome interface and find this option: <strong>Customer Care
-> Complaints and Compliments -> Register your Complaint</strong>. I found this
page.</p>

<p><img src="/images/3.jpg" alt="3.jpg" /></p>

<p>Here, as soon as I enter my phone number and click on the Salutation column, the
whole page refreshes, and shows this dumb message:</p>

<p><img src="/images/4.jpg" alt="4.jpg" />
<img src="/images/5.jpg" alt="5.jpg" /></p>

<p>I had already logged in, so what did register for my Account mean? I didnt know.
I decided to click on the <strong>&#8220;Click Here&#8221;</strong> link. And voila, look what happened:</p>

<p><img src="/images/6.jpg" alt="6.jpg" /></p>

<p>There you go. Notice carefully, the inner page is the same template as of the outer page.
Also, this is not just once. It happens infinite times -</p>

<p><img src="/images/7.jpg" alt="7.jpg" /></p>

<p>The last way to voice our dissent is also <em>poof</em> gone. I couldn&#8217;t just talk to
anyone.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Now I realize the gravity of the situation:</p>

<ul>
<li>The industry is becoming autocratic - it doesn&#8217;t bother about the customer
anymore.</li>
<li>Customer care is no longer important, even if we pay for the service
before/without knowing if we actually will get the service.</li>
<li>Special offers - they dont have any official documentation. They will
disappear on the click of the button and may never be shown again. And the
company might say &#8220;We didn&#8217;t send any such offer&#8221; or &#8220;You should have known
better&#8221;.</li>
<li>Customer care is irresponsible - they cut your calls, give you blunt replies,
they stonewall you and never connect your call - afterall they control your
calls!</li>
<li>You have to pay for the service before you get it. You cant even be sure what
you get and if you will get or not.</li>
</ul>


<p>I know most of you are wondering why I dont go to the customer court and instead
whine here. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to go to the customer court for even small
issues like this - and they know it, so they exploit customers using small
issues like this! Who would go to court or speak out about this? None!</p>

<p>I wonder if this will become the norm tomorrow. I wonder if the transparency and
honesty that was with these telecom is slowly replaced with arrogance,
dishonesty and cheap tactics. I wonder this is the beginning of
the sad demise of telecom industry.</p>
