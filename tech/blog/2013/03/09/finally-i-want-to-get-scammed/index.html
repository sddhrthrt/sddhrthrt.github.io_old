<div class="entry-content"><p>After reading a couple of times about how people got scammed by popular emails,
like &#8220;I would like you to have my money until I can find a safe passage from moon
back to earth&#8221;, I tried to become a part of one and see how this one pans out.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I got this mail yesterday from, interestingly, a Sgt. Vladir Vicente - that&#8217;s
not even a real name from what I know. The mail had the usual content -</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear,</p>

<p>I am Sgt. Valdir Vicente (3RD INFANTRY DIVISION). I am an American soldier
with British background, serving in the military with the army?s 3rd
infantry division. With a very desperate need for assistance, I have
summed up courage to contact you. I found your contact particulars in an
address journal of a carieer builders database.</p>

<p>I am seeking your kind
assistance to move the sum of $6Millions US Dollars] to you, as far
as I can be assured that my share will be safe in your care until I and my
partner come to you , this is no stolen money, and there are no danger
involved.</p>

<p>My partner and I need a good and reliable person, we can trust to
actualize this dream. The money is from oil proceeds and its legit. We
intend moving it by diplomatic means to you or to a safe and secured
location of your choice. Once the funds get to you,</p>

<p>Please take your 30% out and keep our own 70%.
I shall however leave out other details of this transaction until I
receive an
affirmation of your desire to participate. Please contact me on my
personal email address below for more details.</p>

<p>For more details please visit
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2988455.stm</p>

<p>Yours truly
Sgt Vladir Vicente
<email></p></blockquote>

<p>Now this I came across while I was cleaning out my spam folder, and I instantly
felt like replying to this. I was trying and clicking out humorous spams like
&#8220;siddhartha, study at Phoenix university and expand your career opportunities&#8221;,
but all of them routinely lead to the same surveys or fake click-counters.</p>

<p>This one, this could be a live person on the other side. Like those somalian/
nigerian criminals. So I replied to this mail:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sir,</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be glad to help you out.</p>

<p>Please tell me what I have to do next.</p>

<p>Regards,
Siddhartha.</p></blockquote>

<p>So I&#8217;m just waiting for his reply.</p>

<h3>Update - Sat Mar 09, 23:31</h3>

<p>And I get a reply from this man, I think he&#8217;s a genuine scamster anyway. It&#8217;s fun,
and I cant think of any legal/moral implications of this yet, since I&#8217;m publicly
announcing that I&#8217;m going to do this for experimental purpose only and I don&#8217;t
really have the mood to get scammed.</p>

<p>This man here, he is clever. He gives me an option to go to Malaysia from my
country, India, OR get the money straight into the account. Some level of marketing
this is.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear,</p>

<p>Thanks for your response to my mail.
I will like you to travel to Malaysia where the money is currently deposited with a Diplomatic Finance Vault. Or i will instruct the vault company to deliver the consignment directly to you in your Country.
We will like to invest some part of the money in partnership with you.</p>

<p>My partner is currently serving in Afghanistan while i&#8217;m undergoing treatment here in UK.
So we need your assistance to claim his money.
I need to know if you can be able to travel to Malaysia or if you wish to receive the money in your account.</p>

<p>Waiting for your prompt response.</p>

<p>Best regards,
Valdir Vicente.</p></blockquote>

<p>So that&#8217;s funny. I mean, he actually uses a bait - gives me a bad option and a
GOOD offer. Well, I take the bait.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Valdir,</p>

<p>It is very difficult for me to travel to Malaysia, on such short notice. Although, I would take the pain for a devout soldier like you. But It&#8217;ll be great if you can arrange for the money to be transferred to my account here.</p>

<p>I hope I am not troubling your already injured state. I hope you get alright soon.</p>

<p>Send me pictures of afghanistan and UK!</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Siddhartha</p></blockquote>

<p>I know, it&#8217;s a little bit dramatic, but I want to make sure he thinks I really
fell for him. So now I&#8217;m to wait for some more time.</p>

<p>Good night!</p>
