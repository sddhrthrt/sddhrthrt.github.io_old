<div class="entry-content"><p>That afternoon, we were waiting in our project guide&#8217;s room for my teammate to
arrive.  He came 5 minutes late as usual but this time he had the weirdest
excuse to give. Not so much an excuse, what he said made me forget that he was
actually late - &#8220;there&#8217;s a murdered body in front of the department!&#8221;.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p> Shocked as I should be, I looked out of the transparent wall panes
of the front of the department. These panes line the entire length of the front
side of the building. It&#8217;s a useless ornament pretty much, an exception being
the nice panoramic view that it provides of the old East Side campus.  This time
it wasn&#8217;t so nice, for an ominous crowd was already gathering around a spot on
the side of the highway. Several thoughts crossed my mind
- &#8220;Could it be a student? A teacher? Natural death?  Accident on the highway?
  Animal body?&#8221;. From fourth floor, nothing was clear.</p>

<p>I gave a heads up to my guide about the happenings before we sat down to discuss
the project and he replied &#8220;It&#8217;s all a part of life. Come in, let us continue&#8221;.
We sat down for an hour or so and when we came out, I had an overwhelming desire
to just be down there at the scene to watch the proceedings. The Wire, one of
the best TV shows of all time, has got me hooked to crime scenes and police
work. So I thought I&#8217;d catch a bite of it in real life.</p>

<p>My excitement was slightly dampened when I caught the first glimpse of the scene
- mind you, this was about an hour after the murder. There was no cordoned-off
crime scene. No vehicles with beacons (hey, the politicians need them beacons
to parade around, how can they be spared for silly crime work?). No forensic
experts sweeping for DNA and fingerprints and hair samples, no nothing. There
were a couple of police men staring at this and that, whistling at the
occasional bus that stopped at the bus-stop. There were people, both standing
around and in the buses, staring at the small patch of blood on the ground
&#8216;cordoned off&#8217; using 2 road-blocks from NITK. The most serious looking man in
the scene was the head of Watch at NITK, in his khakhi uniform.</p>

<p>I left the scene soon, because there were only photographers taking photos of
blood and people creating rumors. Before I left, I met the police guy and
asked him, &#8220;What happened?&#8221;. He said, &#8220;Murder&#8221;. Of course.</p>

<p>After chilling out for half an hour in the nearby Amul shop, I came by again
to see what had developed. Hey, there were a couple of police now with gloves
on. Wow, I thought, CSI! The one with the more serious uniform walked around,
searching for something. Hair? Nah, he&#8217;s not getting any, other than some from
the heads of soon-balding guys like me around the crime scene. Murder weapon?
Maybe. But after an hour and half, now I thought it should be a miracle to
find anything useful in a crime scene thronged by civilians.</p>

<p>He bent down and picked up something from the gutter with his gloved hand. A
plastic cover that someone had dumped as waste. Then he came back to crime
scene, and picked up a juice carton that was crushed by a hundred footsteps.
How were they evidences, I still wondered, for they looked like all the other
garbage in our campus. Now he bent down near the blood. As I realized what he
was doing, my mind went numb. He scooped up the bloody mud with the carton,
and put it into the cover from the dump. Carefully, he filled 3 more covers
from the dump with the mud from the crime scene. Then he put them all in
another big cover that his assistant had painstakingly collected from the
dump, then hung it all on the handlebar of his white police Pulsar, took off
his gloves, drove away. CSI done.</p>

<p>Life was back on track as I hurried to SJA to set up stage for the Hindustani
Shehnai concert that was going to start in an hour. As I went about the
arrangements, a friend showed me a photo on her phone which she said was going
viral on WhatsApp. It was a close-up photo of a body lying in foetal position
on ground. His guts were spilled out, right arm cut, fingers scattered, head
bludgeoned and was clearly dead.</p>
