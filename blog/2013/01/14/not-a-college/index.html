<div class="entry-content"><p>Today, like many other days, was eventful, joyous, memorable. As I decided to
return to bed for an early start to tomorrow, this thought crossed my mind. Our
college, like many other great institutions, is a society in itself. Not just a
school where students come and study, but a full-fledged society.</p>

<p>I was speaking to my parents on phone. I told them I had flown a kite and eaten
homemade food brought by Vatsa for Sankranti, a festival celebrated today
(about which I know surprisingly little, I&#8217;ll write when I find out). Then I
realized that if I my life had taken a different turn, I would never experience
all that I am now. I suddenly wanted to express this feeling - even though I&#8217;ve
told this to many friends, I want to write about it again.</p>

<p>So I was put into this hostel when I was 12. Like any other child, I probably
imagined the place to be bad, lonely and frightening. I don&#8217;t remember. I
couldn&#8217;t fit in easily, since everyone here was new. Then I slowly changed,
became a better person after countless punishments by caring teachers and care
from friends. When I left the college, I had a some friends that will last for
life, some teachers who had teardrops on their cheeks as I said goodbye and
some moments that would be etched in my heart forever.</p>

<p>Then I joined the current college. I had trouble again, because again, I really
had less friends. But as years have progressed, things changed. Someone brings
you food for festivals, someone cares if you have applied for an internship,
someone plans ahead for your birthday, you fly kites, go on random trips, trust
unconditionally and share your lives with. You fall in love, you make
unbreakable friendships.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve lived most part of my life in a pseudo-family that&#8217;s not my own family. But
I never once felt not at home. It&#8217;s unexplainable how you don&#8217;t miss your own
family once you are in a society like this, but it certainly is special. Thank
you all who are a part of mine.</p>
