<div class="entry-content"><p>Le me dozing off in Intuit office - jobless on the first day - on my comfortable
SteelCase chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Wake up!&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m up. It&#8217;s my mentor Harsh Vardhan Gupta. He has a serious look on his face, and his phone in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;The team manager is back from the US. He tried to wake you up, but you wouldn&#8217;t respond. He called me.&#8221;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I took a few more moments, still sleepy after the heavy lunch.</p>

<p>&#8220;He just came in. He wanted to see you, but he found you sleeping with Facebook open on your
screen. He&#8217;s pissed off!&#8221;</p>

<p>I slowly realized the gravity of the situation. I just screwed up my first meeting with my team manager. I probably even screwed up my
chances with Intuit.</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Did he come in? He saw me sleeping?&#8221;, I asked, rubbing my eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he tried to wake you up. He&#8217;s off for a meeting now. He asked me to send him your phone number.&#8221;, he said, and in a hurry took down my
number on his mobile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alright, he&#8217;s angry, so probably you should see him as soon as he&#8217;s back!&#8221;</p>

<p>The colleagues voiced their concern, too. &#8220;Harsh, you meet
the manager first!&#8221;, &#8220;Siddhartha, go apologize!&#8221;, &#8220;He&#8217;s not that bad either, he
might forgive you..&#8221;, they said. Nothing helped the mood.</p>

<p>I washed my face. Tried to do something work-related, but was just plain worried. I
was imagining the manager, and was nervous like shit.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Then the whole office burst out into laughter, and they come and pat my back and
apologize.</p>

<p>The manager is still in the US. Intuit doesn&#8217;t care if we sleep during work,
heck, they even have a sleeping room. Intuit has begun well indeed.</p>
