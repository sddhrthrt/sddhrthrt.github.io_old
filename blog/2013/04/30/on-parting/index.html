<div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s not often that you end up with a circle of friends that become a part of
you. You wont know it until it&#8217;s time to bid adieu, as with all other things.
But once you realize it, you hope that, you know, time stops. Just one more
outing, one more trek, one more day of fun. Until that inevitable separation
comes.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It&#8217;s only getting worse as we are growing older, and world is getting smaller.
By separating I don&#8217;t mean that we are no longer going to the same school but
living in the same town, as it was with our childhood friends. This time, we
came from far off places, and we are going even further. Chances are, we are not
going to meet for a long time.</p>

<p>Is it going to matter? I told myself that we are going to find new friends,
visit new places and hang out with new circles until one day, soon enough, we&#8217;d
stop missing the old <em>junta</em>. It&#8217;s only the fear now, but it&#8217;ll be better in
future, I assured myself. &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s nice to change, who knows, it might all be
for good.. Chill.. &#8220;, I assured Raja who was apprehensive about the same
thing.</p>

<p>One thing is for sure. Times are not going to be as sweet as they were during
the past couple of years. Neither are we going to be adolescent and in college
again, or are we going to have a company as fine as this. Come what may, nothing
can parallel the world we shared, the moments we spent laughing, eating or
strolling together. The <em>pani-puri</em> will carry the memories with each bite, as
will every outing in future.</p>

<p>That dream, of coming together some day, going on a trip to Europe and
participating in <em>La Tomatino</em> like in one of those movies is already forming.
Hell, even a proposal of buying a custom-made bus and roaming the country is already
being proposed by Raja. It should sound easy, take  a weekend off, meet up and have fun.
How difficult can it be to do that? Future remains to be seen.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ya&#8217;ll will go away, <br/>
some across seas, <br/>
some to universities, <br/>
and some to work, <br/>
but away it is.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no end to hoping this would never end.<br/>
On the road ahead, see you around the bend!</p></blockquote>
